# last-words
A python script that will send your "last words" to your online/irl friends.
Needs to have a user-set timer and if the owner doesn't reset the timer, it will initiate the process. 
I do not know if there is a term for my "timer system"

I figured python would be the best option because of it's popularity amongst new developers.
So you can run this any platform that runs python.


TODO:

Add ability to kink discord accounts since it's one of the most popular and the one that i am familiar with.

Research about non-bot accunt automation and TOS.

Add the basic timer system
